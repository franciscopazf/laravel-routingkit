// This enum defines the types of file support available in the routing kit.
// - OBJECT_FILE_TREE: Represents a file that supports a tree structure of objects.
// - OBJECT_FILE_PLAIN: Represents a file that supports a plain structure of objects.
// This enum can be used to determine how to handle file operations based on the type of file support required.
// Usage example:
// $fileSupportType = RkFileSupportEnum::OBJECT_FILE_TREE;
// if ($fileSupportType === RkFileSupportEnum::OBJECT_FILE_TREE) {
//     // Handle tree structure file operations
// } elseif ($fileSupportType === RkFileSupportEnum::OBJECT_FILE_PLAIN) {
//     // Handle plain structure file operations
// }
